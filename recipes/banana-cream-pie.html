        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>One of my friends was known for her banana cream pie. She knew how 
                it was Dean's favorite pie and so she would surprise him and bring 
                it on over. Sometimes he would eat the entire pie by himself! I asked 
                her the secrets to making the best banana cream pie and I was shocked 
                how simple it was! This is such an easy pie to whip up for Thanksgiving or a Sunday dinner. 
                It takes less than 10 minutes to make the filling and the homemade pie 
                crust is super easy!</p>
            <p>This Banana Cream Pie starts off with vanilla pudding, cold water, sweetened 
                condensed milk, and freshly whipped whipping cream. That's how simple the 
                filling is! Then you layer it with fresh bananas in a buttery pie crust 
                and top it with a layer of sweetened whipped cream. It couldn't be easier! 
                Now you are going to have to keep yourself from eating the entire bowl of 
                filling -- it is that good!</p>
            <p>The homemade all-butter pie crust is made with butter, flour, salt, and 
                buttermilk or a milk/vinegar mixture. You can even throw it into a food 
                processor and it takes less than 2 minutes to make a homemade pie crust. 
                If you don't want to make a homemade pie crust, feel free to use a 
                pre-made crust. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup COLD Butter (cut into cubes)</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups Flour</li>

            </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <em>To make filling: </em>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, stir together pudding mix, cold water, and sweetened 
                    condensed milk. To get it extra smooth, I suggest using a whisk. Place in the 
                    refrigerator to chill for several minutes.</li>
                <li>In another mixing bowl, whip 1 cup of heavy cream until soft peaks form. Carefully 
                    fold into the pudding mixture and then cover and return to the refrigerator to 
                    chill.</li>
                <li>Pre-baked crust and let cool. Once cooled, layer with sliced bananas. To prevent 
                    browning, toss bananas with fresh lemon juice or sprinkle with Fruit fresh. Top 
                    bananas with pudding mixture.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, whip the remaining 1 cup of heavy cream until soft peaks form. 
                    Fold in powdered sugar to sweeten. Spread on top of the pie. Return to the 
                    refrigerator and let set up for 3-4 hours before serving.</li>
            </ol>

            <em>To make crust: </em>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir together flour and salt. Slice cold butter into tiny shreds (I store my butter 
                    in the freezer) and add to bowl or food processor. Pulse until coarse meal or small 
                    peas form. .If you are blind baking the crust and not filling the crust with a baked 
                    filling, poke holes using fork along sides and bottom of crust. This will help keep 
                    the crust from puffing up while it bakes.Use Pie Weights, Rice, or Beans to keep 
                    crust in place. If you are blind baking your crust to be filled later with a cream 
                    filling, it is important to keep it in place. Line the crust with foil or parchment 
                    paper. Fill it with pie weights, rice, or beans and press against the sides of the 
                    crust.</li>
                <li>Slowly add ice cold water, 1-2 tablespoons at a time to butter-flour mixture. Add 
                    vinegar and pulse until it starts to form together.</li>
                <li>Press dough into a ball. Pat each ball into a disk, tightly wrap in Saran Wrap and let 
                    it chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. 2 hours is preferred. Unwrap the 
                    dough, turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and roll it out, using a 
                    rolling pin. Don't overwork the dough. The key is to work quickly to keep the dough as 
                    cold as possible.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Roll it to at least a 13-inch diameter circle. Fold the 
                    dough in half and gently lift and position it over the pie pan. Unfold. Press the dough 
                    against the sides and bottom of a pan. Flute the edges by pressing the dough between 
                    the index finger and thumb of one hand and using the index finger of the other hand to 
                    make the scallop.</li>
                <li>To blind bake the crust, poke holes using fork along sides and bottom of crust. This 
                    will help keep the crust from puffing up while it bakes. Use Pie Weights, Rice, or 
                    Beans to keep crust in place. If you are blind baking your crust to be filled later 
                    with a cream filling, it is important to keep it in place. Line the crust with foil or 
                    parchment paper. Fill it with pie weights, rice, or beans and press against the sides 
                    of the crust.</li>
                <li>Bake at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes. Remove parchment paper and pie weights and return 
                    to oven and cook for an additional 6-8 minutes (for a total of 16-20 minutes cooking time).</li>
