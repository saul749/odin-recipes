        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>One of my friends was known for her banana cream pie. She knew how 
                it was Dean's favorite pie and so she would surprise him and bring 
                it on over. Sometimes he would eat the entire pie by himself! I asked 
                her the secrets to making the best banana cream pie and I was shocked 
                how simple it was! This is such an easy pie to whip up for Thanksgiving or a Sunday dinner. 
                It takes less than 10 minutes to make the filling and the homemade pie 
                crust is super easy!</p>
            <p>This Banana Cream Pie starts off with vanilla pudding, cold water, sweetened 
                condensed milk, and freshly whipped whipping cream. That's how simple the 
                filling is! Then you layer it with fresh bananas in a buttery pie crust 
                and top it with a layer of sweetened whipped cream. It couldn't be easier! 
                Now you are going to have to keep yourself from eating the entire bowl of 
                filling -- it is that good!</p>
            <p>The homemade all-butter pie crust is made with butter, flour, salt, and 
                buttermilk or a milk/vinegar mixture. You can even throw it into a food 
                processor and it takes less than 2 minutes to make a homemade pie crust. 
                If you don't want to make a homemade pie crust, feel free to use a 
                pre-made crust. </p>
