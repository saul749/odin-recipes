            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>There are certain recipes that are essential to have in your recipe box 
                and one of them has to be a phenomenal Fettuccine alfredo recipe.  Years 
                ago, when I was teaching kids' cooking classes, this was one of the first 
                things I taught them. Almost every single kid around goes crazy for alfredo 
                sauce! It is so easy to make a homemade alfredo sauce that you will never 
                buy the jarred variety again! This homemade alfredo sauce is made with 
                simple ingredients -- butter, parmesan cheese, garlic, heavy cream, and salt. 
                It's a 5-ingredient alfredo sauce that is beyond easy!</p>
            <p>This homemade alfredo sauce can be tossed with the pasta so the pasta soaks up 
                all of the sauce or it can be spooned over hot, fresh pasta.  I love to use 
                fresh refrigerated fettuccine noodles because it tastes that much better. If 
                you want the fettuccine alfredo to be a little more "saucy" toss the sauce with 
                less than one pound of pasta (you may start with 12 ounces of fettuccine).</p>
