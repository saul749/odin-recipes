            <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>There are certain recipes that are essential to have in your recipe box 
                    and one of them has to be a phenomenal Fettuccine alfredo recipe.  Years 
                    ago, when I was teaching kids' cooking classes, this was one of the first 
                    things I taught them. Almost every single kid around goes crazy for alfredo 
                    sauce! It is so easy to make a homemade alfredo sauce that you will never 
                    buy the jarred variety again! This homemade alfredo sauce is made with 
                    simple ingredients -- butter, parmesan cheese, garlic, heavy cream, and salt. 
                    It's a 5-ingredient alfredo sauce that is beyond easy!</p>
                <p>This homemade alfredo sauce can be tossed with the pasta so the pasta soaks up 
                    all of the sauce or it can be spooned over hot, fresh pasta.  I love to use 
                    fresh refrigerated fettuccine noodles because it tastes that much better. If 
                    you want the fettuccine alfredo to be a little more "saucy" toss the sauce with 
                    less than one pound of pasta (you may start with 12 ounces of fettuccine).</p>
            
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 lb Fettucine Pasta</li>
                        <li>6 tablespoons Butter</li>
                        <li>1 Garlic Clove <em>(minced)</em></li>
                        <li>1 1/2 cups Heavy Cream</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
                        <li>1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon Pepper</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons Italian Parsley <em>(optional)</em></li>
                    </ul>
            
            <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to 
                            season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according 
                            to package instructions. </li>
                        <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced 
                            garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.</li>
                        <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the 
                            parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat 
                            and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
                        <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to 
                            thin out the sauce.</li>
                        <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. 
                            Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta 
                            water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
                        <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
                    </ol>
