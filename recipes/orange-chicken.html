        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>My kids are always begging me to take them to grab Chinese food. They are 
                obsessed with orange chicken but I am never really sure what's in it... 
                especially if they get it from a drive-thru. I wanted to create a version 
                at home, made from scratch, with all-natural ingredients. It still has the 
                same incredible flavor they love. It's definitely a win-win in our home.</p>
            <p>It is wintertime in Arizona which means that the citrus is ripe for the 
                picking. I am surrounded by neighbors who have a plethora of fresh oranges 
                and lemons hanging from their trees. This is the perfect time of year to 
                whip up orange and lemon dishes especially this Chinese Orange Chicken.</p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <em>To make orange sauce: </em>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium pot, add orange juice, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, 
                    garlic, and red chili flakes. Heat for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, whisk 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 Tablespoons 
                    of water to form a paste. Add to orange sauce and whisk together. 
                    Continue to cook for 5 minutes, until the mixture begins to thicken. 
                    Once the sauce is thickened, remove from heat and add orange zest.</li>
            </ol>

            <em>To make chicken: </em>
            <ol>
                <li>Place flour and cornstarch in a shallow dish or pie plate. Add a pinch 
                    of salt. Stir.</li>
                <li>Whisk eggs in shallow dish.</li>
                <li>Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture and then flour mixture. Place on 
                    plate.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 -3 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. 
                    Using a thermometer, watch for it to reach 350 degrees.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, cook several chicken pieces at a time. Cook for 2-3 
                    minutes, turning often until golden brown. Place chicken on a 
                    paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat.</li>
                <li>Toss chicken with orange sauce. You may reserve some of the sauce to place 
                    on rice. Serve it with a sprinkling of green onion and orange zest, if so 
                    desired.</li>
